# AI-RAG-Toolkit
A versatile Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toolkit designed for exploring and integrating various AI models, including local LLMs (Ollama) and API-based services (Gemini, ChatGPT). This project aims to be a flexible platform for experimenting with advanced RAG architectures and other AI functionalities.

#Please note that the menu is currently in German, as this project was initially developed to support my university studies.
